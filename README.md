# Installation

```
# Install `gulp` globally
npm install --global gulp
# Install node dependencies
npm install
```

# Development

You must load the development server pages (e.g., `src/demos/game.html` or `communication_iframe/index.html`) with an origin (i.e., using a server). If you're running locally, use `gulp` to fire up a local server:

    gulp server

Then open up the server URL in your browser (the URL will appear in your console).
